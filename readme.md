# Ussuri Framework for Lua and LÖVE

Ussuri is designed for use with LÖVE 0.8.0 and Lua 5.1 and **was** under a volatile development cycle with features coming in and out and rewrites happening quite often.

Ussuri is named after a conglomerate of things such as a river, a bay, and several types of animal. You can use Ussuri for a lot of things too, but it's mostly intended for games.

For the latest features, check out the **dev** branch. For more stable development, look for a **release-x.x.x** branch or the **stable** branch. I'll try to keep those branches working, but there are no guarantees for the dev branch.

This work is covered under the zlib/libpng license, with more detail available in license.txt

**Development has stopped on this project entirely.**
