# Ussuri Framework for Lua and LÖVE

Ussuri is designed for use with LÖVE 0.8.0 and Lua 5.1 and is under a volatile development cycle with features coming in and out and rewrites happening quite often. It is not entirely suited for development yet, but it has been used in two Ludum Dare entries thus far.

Ussuri is named after a conglomerate of things such as a river, a bay, and several types of animal. You can use Ussuri for a lot of things too, but it's mostly intended for games.

For the latest features, check out the **dev** branch, but for stable development, look for a **release-x.x.x** branch or the **stable** branch.

**If you are able to assist in testing for multiple platforms, email me at me@lpghatguy.com as I presently am the only one testing the framework and doing so under Windows 8.**
